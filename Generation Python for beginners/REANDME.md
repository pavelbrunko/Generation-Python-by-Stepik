# Generation Python for beginners

In this course I've learned some basics of Python language. To practice achived knoledge in the end of the course there are some suggested mini-projects to do. They are presenting in this repository.

### Numerical guessing game

In this mini-project I created a programm which can made off a number from 0 to 100 and you have to guess what the number is. The program provides a limit on the range of the entered digit (strictly from 0 to 100), and also takes into account the number of attempts required to guess the digit.

### Password generator 

This programm can create for you several number of strong passwords (you can input the number of passwords you need). The password consists of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits and other symbals like #, !, $ etc.

### Magic ball

This programm is about well-known mystic 8 ball, a ball of fate, a ball of questions and answers, a ball of predictions â€” a toy, a comic way to predict the future.
At the input programm expect a question from you, to which you want to know the answer. At the output programm returns to one random answer from twenty posible.

### Encoder/Decoder

This mini-project can encode for you word, phrase or even sentence using caesar's code. For the input programm expect from you a sentence needed to be translated and the n - integer number for encoding. For the decoding you also need to write a sentence and the key (n), if you know it. If you don't know the key you can try to guess it by iterating through all the numbers from 1 to 32 or 25 for the Russian and English alphabets , respectively. You can encoder and decoder and English, and Russian sentences.
